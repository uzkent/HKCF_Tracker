## HKCF_Tracker
This repo contains the deep hyperspectral kernelized correlation filter tracker MATLAB implementation. More information on the HKCF
can be found in our following paper :

Our HKCF tracker utilizes two features to learn to minimize the ridge regression function. They are
1. Fast Histogram of Oriented Gradients
2. VGGNet 5th Layer Convolutional Features.

The HKCF tracker is designed to track objects from aerial platforms that can record RGB images. We test it
on our synthetic hyperspectral scenario generated by the `Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing` software. 
Our scenario comes with `61` channels captured over the part of Rochester, NY. The duration of the 
scenario is 110 sec. and comes with 157 frames and 1.42 frame rate per second.
